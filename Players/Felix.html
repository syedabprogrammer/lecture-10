    <p>Félix initially trained at Porto's youth academy, before moving to rivals Benfica in 2015. He began playing for the latter's reserve team a year later and was promoted to the first team in 2018, making his debut at age 17. He helped Benfica win the league title in his first and only season with them, and was awarded Primeira Liga's Best Young Player of the Year and the Golden Boy award. In 2019, at age 19, Félix signed with Atlético Madrid for a club-record transfer worth €126 million (£113 million), the fourth-most expensive football transfer. In his second season at the club, he helped the team win the 2020–21 La Liga, which ended the club's seven-year league title drought. <br>

        Félix is a former Portugal youth international, representing his country at under-18, under-19, and under-21 levels. He earned his first cap for the senior national team during the semi-finals of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals, winning the inaugural edition of the competition with his nation on home soil. <br>

        Early career <br>
        Félix started playing football at Os Pestinhas in 2007 before joining the youth ranks of FC Porto a year later at age eight.[7] After Félix moved to Porto, he faced challenges such as extensive schedules including daily shuttle hours between Viseu and Porto.[8] He moved out of his parents' house at age 12 to live near Porto's youth training grounds;[8] in a later interview, Félix revealed that during this time he considered quitting football due to the lack of playing time, but his father convinced him to pursue his career.[9] Félix was released by Porto in 2014 because of his slight frame (he denied these claims and said he left of his own volition)[10] and moved to Lisbon rivals Benfica in 2015, at age 15, after a season-lon</p>

        <p>Félix debuted professionally at age 16 for Benfica's reserve team in LigaPro on 17 September 2016, as an 83rd-minute substitute for Aurélio Buta in a goalless draw at Freamunde. At the time, he was the youngest player to debut for Benfica B,[14] a record since been broken by Cher Ndour in May 2021.[15] He played 13 matches and scored three goals over the season, the first being a consolation in a 2–1 loss to his hometown team Académico de Viseu on 15 February 2017.[16] Later, on 30 January 2018, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 home win over Famalicão.[17] During that season, Félix played in the 2016–17 UEFA Youth League, in which he was a key part of Benfica reaching the final of the competition, which it lost to Red Bull Salzburg (2–1), scoring six goals in the tournament. <br>

            2018–19: Rise to the first team and league title <br>
            Félix was promoted to Benfica's first team for the 2018–19 season, making his debut in a 2–0 Primeira Liga win at Boavista on 18 August. A week later, he scored his first Primeira Liga goal, thus becoming the youngest player to score in the Lisbon derby, which ended in a 1–1 tie.[19] On 16 January 2019, he scored the qualifying goal against Vitória de Guimarães in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals.[20] After Bruno Lage took over as coach of Benfica, his first decision was to use Félix more regularly, partnering him with Haris Seferovic in the attack, taking advantage of the bad run of Facundo Ferreyra and Nicolás Castillo and the injury of Jonas.[21] Later on, Félix was praised for his performance in a 4–2 away win over Sporting CP in the league on 3 February,[22] subsequently sparking interest from several European clubs.[23] A month later, he scored the equaliser in a 2–1 away comeback win over Porto in the O Clássico, allowing his side to overtake their rivals at the top of the Primeira Liga table <br>
            
            On 11 April 2019 <br>, Félix scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 UEFA Europa League win over Eintracht Frankfurt. In doing so, he became the youngest ever player (aged 19 years and 152 days) to score a hat-trick in the competition, breaking Marko Pjaca's record by 67 days.[25] Félix finished his first season with 20 goals for his team, including one on the final day of the league campaign, in a 4–1 win over Santa Clara to seal the title;[26] his 15 league goals put him joint-fourth for the season.[27] Across Europe's seven best leagues, he ranked second among teenagers for goals and assists, behind Kai Havertz and Jadon Sancho, respectively</p>
