    <h2 style="margin-left: 38%;"><u>Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi</u></h2>
     born 24 June 19 is an Argentine professional footballer <br>plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. <br>Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA. <br> Messi is the most decorated player in the history of professional football, with 45 senior trophies. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won two Copa América titles and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists (192) in La Liga, most appearances  and assists (18) in the Copa América. He has the most international goals (109) and appearances (187) by a South American male. Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672). <br>

Messi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Messi won four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival, before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, and was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. He signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons there and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August. <br>

<p>Argentina's government have announced that Julio Garro is no longer the country's undersecretary of sport after he called for Lionel Messi to apologise for the national team's derogatory song about French players. <br>


    Chelsea's Argentinian midfielder Enzo Fernández apologised earlier this week after he had posted a video on social media following his team's 1-0 win over Colombia in Sunday's Copa América final that showed some Argentina players singing offensive chants that singled out France players of African heritage. <br>

    The French Football Federation (FFF) said on Tuesday it would file a legal complaint while FIFA also said it was looking into the incident.
    
    "I think the captain [Messi] of the national team and AFA [Argentina Football Association's] president [Claudio Tapia] should come out and apologise for this case," Garro told Argentinian radio Urbano Play. <br>
    
    "It is fitting. It [controversy] leaves us in a bad light with so much glory." <br>
    
    The office of Argentina's president Javier Milei issued a statement on X and wrote: "The President's Office reports that no government can tell what to comment, what to think or what to do to the Argentina National Team, World Champion and Two-time American Champion, or to any other citizen. For this reason, Julio Garro ceases to be Undersecretary of Sports of the Nation." <br>
    
    Garro later thanked Milei for allowing him to be a part of his team and wrote on X: "I am very sorry if my comment offended anyone, that was never my intention, and that is why I made my resignation available, although I will always be on the other side of discrimination in all its forms." <br>
    
    Fernandez's club, Chelsea, meanwhile, condemned all discriminatory behaviour, and started an internal disciplinary procedure over the offensive chants.
